# Reko Tech Website

A custom single-page site for Reko Tech's IT consulting practice. It blends handcrafted HTML, modern CSS, and a bit of JavaScript for theme control, motion, and responsive navigation.

## Highlights
- **Themes & Glow** – Multiple palette presets, animated favicon, and a synced heartbeat background that reacts to mouse/tilt.
- **Responsive Navigation** – Fancy animated burger menu, accessible mobile panel, and smooth scroll links.
- **Animated Sections** – Core Skills pills, Experience timeline, hero cards, and contact links use layered gradients plus hover/tilt motion.
- **Contact Links** – GitHub, LinkedIn, and Gmail tiles with subtle micro-interactions.

## Stack
- HTML5 + CSS3 (no framework)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- SVG assets for logo and favicon

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. For live reloading, serve the folder with your favorite static server (e.g., `npx serve .`).

## Customizing
- Update **content** inside `index.html` (skills, experience, contact data).
- Tweak **styles** in `assets/css/styles.css` (themes, animations, layout).
- Adjust **interactions** in `assets/js/main.js` (theme cycling, mobile nav, tilt/mouse effects).

## Notes
- Designed desktop-first with refined mobile breakpoints.
- Requires user gesture on iOS to enable tilt animations.
- Everything is selectable-off (`user-select: none`) per client request.
